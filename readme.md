With this code one can use graph2font or rasterconverter to produce a picture for ATARI 8-bit and then use music
converted via RMT2LZSS tool (or similar), type in some text and finally get a picture with music playing plus a
simple scroller.

But esp. the Rasterconverter uses a lot of CPU time, so maybe sound plus scroller is not possible!
And don't forget to adjust your picture height, to have some room left for scroller.

The whole structure can be imported to WUDSN workspace and assembled direct there by assembling main files (eighter
in g2f or rasterconverter folder).
