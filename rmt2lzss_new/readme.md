You can use this routines to play back 4 channel LZSS files on your ATARI.
Stereo POKEY detection is included and it will play back the song on both POKEYS if available.
I just adapted original sources from vinscool, rensoup and dmsc to be able to use songs in my productions.
All the player code is not my work. Thanks for original coders for their work.
